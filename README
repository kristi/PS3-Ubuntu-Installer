Ubuntu Installer for the Playstation 3 System.
* This not in anyway endorsed by Sony and all other Sony companies/entities that are in existance.
* All software written here was written by hand and does not use any Sony Proprietary Code.

These are the first attempts at an official installer for the PS3.

Reasons for this installer:
- People make mistakes.  Simple as that. To err is human.
- This installer is to automate and hopefully cut down on chatter in the IRC rooms
- Make installing Ubuntu easier on the PS3.


A changelog will be provided here:

v0.01
- Script echo's "I do not work yet".
